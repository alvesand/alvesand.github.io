I am a statistical geneticist, currently working as Research Associate at [Dr. Rosa's lab](https://www.gjmrosa.org/) (University of Wisconsin-Madison). I am broadly interested in the application and development of efficient statistical learning methods for the analysis of livestock data, with a focus on the genomics and phenomics of complex traits in different domestic species. My research agenda centers on conciliating molecular information, sensor-enabled data, and efficient statistical learning methods for improving animal production, reproduction, welfare and health, supporting better farming efficiency.

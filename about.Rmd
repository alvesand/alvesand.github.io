I was born and raised in Brazil, where I earned my BS in Animal Science from the State University Vale do Acarau (2014), MS in Animal Science from Federal University of Ceara (2016), and Ph.D. in Animal Breeding and Genetics from Sao Paulo State University (2019). I am currently working as a Research Associate at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and have served as Professor at the Federal Institute Education, Science and Technology of Maranh√£o until 2021. I am broadly interested in the development and application of efficient statistical methods and machine learning algorithms for solving real-life problems related to the genetics and genomics of complex traits with economic importance in different domestic species such as dairy goats, sheep, beef cattle, and broilers. More recently I have been also involved in precision livestock farming projects, including the development of high-throughput phenotyping techniques driven with different data sources such as digital images and audio signals.
